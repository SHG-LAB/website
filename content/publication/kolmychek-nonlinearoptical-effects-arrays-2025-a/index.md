abstract: Abstract             Nonlinear-optical effects in magnetic composite nanostructures
  are of fundamental and practical interest. Here we study, on the micro- and macro-scales,
  the nonlinear-optical and magnetooptical response of metasurfaces made of arrays
  of magnetic Co/Au plasmonic particles on the crystalline garnet layer. We find a
  manyfold enhancement of the efficiency of the optical second harmonic generation
  as well as a strong modification of the magnetooptical response of this metasurface
  as compared to the pure garnet film. Numerical modelling of the local electromagnetic
  field confirms these findings.
